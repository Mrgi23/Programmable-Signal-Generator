# Programmable Signal Generator

## Description
The **Programmable Signal Generator** is a fully software-simulated system designed for high-precision signal synthesis and modulation. It enables the generation of custom waveforms with fine frequency resolution, making it suitable for signal processing simulations, software-defined radio (SDR) testing, and general-purpose waveform generation.

### Key Features
- **Fully Software-Based** – No external hardware is required.
- **High-Precision Interpolation & Frequency Shifting** – Uses a CORDIC-based complex mixer for precise frequency shift.
- **Multi-Language Support** – Implemented in both **Python** and **C++** for flexible performance trade-offs.
- **Multiple Output Modes** – Supports NRZ and RF DAC simulation.
- **Ideal for Research & Education** – A valuable tool for algorithm development, DSP research, and software-based testing.
